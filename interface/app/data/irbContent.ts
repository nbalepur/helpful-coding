## Study Title
Understanding the Impact of AI-Assisted Coding on Developer Productivity and Learning

## Purpose of the Study
This research study aims to understand how artificial intelligence (AI) tools affect coding practices, learning outcomes, and developer productivity. We are interested in studying how developers interact with AI-powered coding assistants and the impact these tools have on their work.

## What You Will Be Asked to Do
If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to:

- Complete coding tasks using our AI-assisted coding platform
- Allow us to collect data about your coding interactions and patterns
- Optionally participate in brief surveys about your experience
- Optionally participate in follow-up interviews (approximately 30 minutes)

## Data Collection
We will collect the following types of data:

- Code you write and modifications you make
- Your interactions with AI suggestions and tools
- Time spent on different tasks
- Survey responses and interview recordings (if you choose to participate)
- Basic demographic information (age range, programming experience level)

## Confidentiality
Your participation is confidential. We will not share your personal information or individual coding data with anyone outside the research team. All data will be stored securely and anonymized in any publications or presentations. Your identity will never be revealed in any research reports.

## Risks and Benefits
**Risks:** There are minimal risks associated with this study. You may feel some pressure while coding under observation, but you can take breaks as needed.

**Benefits:** You will have access to advanced AI coding tools and may learn new programming techniques. Your participation will contribute to important research about the future of software development.

## Your Rights
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may withdraw at any time without penalty. You may also skip any questions or tasks that make you uncomfortable. If you have any questions about this study, please contact the research team.
